Create a class called DuplicateRemover. 
Create an instance method called remove that takes a single parameter called dataFile of type String
 (representing the path to a text file) and uses a Set of Strings to eliminate duplicate words from the file
  referenced by dataFile. The unique words should be stored in an instance variable called uniqueWords.
   Create an instance method called write that takes a single parameter called outputFile
    (representing the path to a text file) and writes the words contained in uniqueWords to the file pointed
     to by outputFile. 
The output file should be overwritten if it already exists, and created if it does not exist.
